## Application Details

This application is used as a dual purpose tool to search for job listings in a givin area, and to search for relevant news articles.  Once you have entered in your search criteria you are brought to another page that displays the job listings and news articles.  This is a great tool for learning about something new to you as a developer by reading the articles provided, and for looking for a new job within your area or a new area if you are looking to move.  

The landing page presents you with the information about the application.  This page also allows you to enter your search criteria.  You will see two input fields on the page.  The first field, the one on the left, is where you enter your search terms that will filter what you are looking for.  For example IF you wanted to lookup Ruby or Vue.js then you would enter "Ruby" or "Vue.js" in that field.  The second search field is where you enter the city that you want to search for job listings in.  For example if you wanted to lookup listings in Washington DC then you would just enter "Washington DC" in that search field.  Once you have your search term and city location entered just click on the search button and get your results.

After you hit the search button on the landing page you are brought to a new page that displays the searched criteria.  You will see two list sections on this page side-by-side.  On the left is the job listings results, and on the right is the related news articles.  Displayed within the job list is the job position, the posted date, the city, the company that posted the job, and a brief job description.  For more information, or to view the full job listing, click on the job title to be brought to the application page.  This section loads the 10 current job postings at a time.  At the bottom of the section is a next and previous button that will load the next set of 10 or allow you to go back and view the previous set.
